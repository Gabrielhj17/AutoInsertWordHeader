# AutoInsertWordHeader
Macro to auto insert name and the current date into Microsoft word header

This VB macro for word basically does what it says on the tin. I always have my name and the current date in the header of any word file I create and wanted to find a way to streamline this process. I also setup a keyboard shortcut to run this macro to make things even easier. You could probaly have this macro setup to auto run but i decided against this as there may be times when i dont want to fill in the header. The macro is by no means optimized and the alignment of the date isnt great/done properly but i made it work for me, any improvements will be graciously recieved.
